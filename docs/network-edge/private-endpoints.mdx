## Introduction

In addition to [public endpoints][Public Endpoints], ngrok also supports creating Private Endpoints which are specific to your account.

All private endpoints end in `.private`, and are specific to one ngrok account.

Private endpoints cannot be accessed directly, but rather can only be accessed using the [forward-internal][forward-internal] policy action.

### Creating a Private Endpoint

A private endpoint may be created by specifying a binding of `private` for your endpoint. Specifically, when using the agent, a `private` endpoint may be created like so:

```bash
ngrok http --binding private --url "some.name.private" 8080
```

A private endpoint may listen on any port (such as `--url "some.name.private:1234"`) and any protocol scheme (such as `ngrok tcp` and `ngrok tls`).
